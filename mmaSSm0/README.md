As a result of running
```
math -script plot.m
```
the following plots should be produced for quarks(`pltQQ.pdf`):

![pltQQ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2252ec-81e3-435e-b6ce-87a0d3d94971)

and gluons (`pltGG.pdf`):
 
![pltGG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/742a32e0-9b01-4621-ba9a-02db707f7ad0)


usual results for `\tilde{I}` and `\tilde{S}` are multiplied by `(1-x)*(1-x*y)` to make functions bounded
